## About The DC Metro Guestimator

Moving out of the DMV, after almost eight long years, I've decided to pay tribute to DC's greatest engineering and urban planning disaster--The DC Metro. The DC Metro Guestimator will allow the user to select a Metro line and a Metro stop. The result will return two arrival time monitors with the next calculated arrival times of incoming trains.


### How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. <br>

In this pet project, played around with the Wahington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) API to pull the estimated arrival times for all train lines at each stop. Then I used CSS to replicate the arrival time monitors in the stations. Let me know if you have any comments or feedback! Lets work together. <br>

Data was pulled from the [WMATA API](https://developer.wmata.com/)

## Lessons Learned:

I've learned how powerful common object and array methods are, such as, .filter(), .map(), and forEach(). My daily coding practice on CodeWars has been extremely helpful and I'm feeling more and more confident manipulating and playing around with API data.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Fully update README
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Refactor, refactor, refactor, & refactor
- [ ] Figure out how to generate Metro Line colors and insert them into the signs
