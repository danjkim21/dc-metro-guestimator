## About The Project

Moving out of the DMV, after almost eight long years, I've decided to pay tribute to DC's greatest engineering and urban planning disaster--The DC Metro. In this pet project, played around with the Wahington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) API to pull the estimated arrival times for all train lines at each stop. Then I used CSS to replicate the arrival time monitors in the stations. Let me know if you have any comments or feedback! Lets work together.

### Built With

This project was done with vanilla CSS, HTML and JS. Data pulled from the [WMATA API](https://developer.wmata.com/)


## Roadmap
